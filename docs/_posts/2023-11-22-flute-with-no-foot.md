I'd just begun playing bansuri, an Indian bamboo flute, and I thought we might find a smaller cheaper travel flute somewhere in Kolkata's many markets. It felt like fate when we stumbled across the shop where my mom had purchased her first harmonium decades ago. All the flutes were ugly except one, which was exceptionally pretty. A dark mark like a burn blessed the mouth hole, and the flute was wrapped in strings of delicate light green, copper, and deep purple. I knew I wanted it even as I embarrassed myself trying to test play it in the shop. I was just starting then and I couldn't always make a reliable sound, and that day the Pa kept failing me. 

Indian music is organized into Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni Sa the same way Western music is organized into Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do. Coincidentally, in the Bengali language the word Pa also means foot. 

Later, when I had a proper teacher, he'd tell me never to buy flutes from the stores--that all the good stores reserved their best flutes for famous musicians, and that even when he went to a new store, he'd have to play C-tier flutes for hours ("no, this one doesn't have good sound, can you show me a better one?") before they'd bring out their B-tier flutes. To get a good Indian flute you gotta know a guy.

So it was no surprise I got scammed hard. It wasn't just my own F-tier playing that made the silent Pa. With flutes you have to synchronize your breath differently with each note to make sound--the higher the note, the faster your air has to be. I couldn't play the Pa because the hole was misplaced, resulting in a decisively flat note. Because I was breathing expecting a tuned Pa, my breath didn't match the actual note being summoned by the fingering, creating no sound. Now when I play the mismatch results in a degraded sound rather than no sound, but at that time even calling a regular note forward was hard.

The symbolism is heavy-handed. You go to the family shop and come home with a wonderful flute, only to realize your flute has no foot. There's your story right there, of what's passed down beautiful and broken. The flute stands for trauma or something. 

Yet here I am traveling with my flute with no Pa. How? Indian classical music knows something quite deep: freedom is beautiful, but flavor rises from restriction. A soup with every ingredient is no soup at all. 

You may have heard that Indian classical music relies on improvisation like jazz. Instead of songs, we have ragas. A raga can be easily recognized but is never the same played twice. Each raga has a series of restrictions, traditions, and moods, and within those structures you are free to improvise. One of these restrictions comes in the form of playable and unplayable notes. For example, there are ragas in which the note Pa is never played...

This flute is broken, yes, because most doors are closed to it. But not all. Without this flute, I would never have met the haunting Pa-less sounds of Raga Bhinna Shadaj so early in my journey. Don't get me wrong, I'm not congratulating myself on my poor flute selection. It's not about regretting or appreciating this path. It's just the way things happened.
