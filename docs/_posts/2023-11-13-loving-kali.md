How strange that we see plants green and then ascribe that greenness to their character. Green is what they've rejected. The sun's light pours down and this green is precisely what was turned away, which we take for the plant's face. 

I'm staring at two leaves on two plants of the same species. They are the same shape, but very different. One is backlit bursting with red and yellow filaments entombed in green. It's saying there is a supernova in each of us, that each of us is the size of a galaxy or at least a planet. When I close my eyes and feel my cells and the constant flow of blood and lightning I forget this fact and instead I know it. The other leaf is black. It spreads its veins through flared bat wings, ready to engulf me, and the thought brings a strange peace.

Black. Black accepts everything, it takes it all in. The true face of inclusion is a deep pitch black. You can find this inside you too. The place you can pour any emotion into, and it eats it all. I haven't figured out if this place is horrifying or the ultimate source of comfort. It's probably both. As wisdom deepens, things transform in ways pointless to anticipate. No doubt this will be true for the black hole within. 

And what of the human face that rejects nothing? Does it come and go while I drink my tea? I wouldn't know.

Ever since I started at the beginning as a novice flute player, my mother sends me videos of little 11 year old flute prodigies which I leave unwatched. I hate those kids. Still can't stop comparing myself unfavorably to them, as long as it's my mother sending me the videos. That's how it always was growing up, with my mom pointing to other kids in the newspaper and never quite having to say "why can't you be like them?" 

Such a technique backfires. You think you're instilling a desire for doing something great in your kids, but that desire is just a mask for another one. The desire for homecoming. The desire to exist in the gaze of loved ones and feel the sun on one's unrejected, unrejecting face. I haven't talked to my mother about this and I know her intentions are good. Such systems root so deeply people aren't even aware they are in operation. 

Kali is the black faced goddess of rampage. She manifests this way, she is this face of the goddess, but there are many more. Some are kind, gentle, loving, prosperous. She is loving too but her love is mixed with rage and bloodlust. As the story goes, she was summoned to war to defeat a terrible enemy and she did. His magical drops of blood touched the ground and sprang up as new enemies, so she drank every drop she shed as she fought. A genocidal mother who leaves no trace of her foe.

But making war on the great enemy will consume you too. After she came home, she didn't know how to stop fighting. She killed indiscriminately, the garland of skulls around her neck dancing as she did. Only when she hurt her closest loved one did she come to her senses, awakening from wrath into shame. 


What my people know is that this too is a mother's love. Love mixed with rage, born of war and struggle, passing from generation to generation. Most people know an imperfect love and continue to offer what they have received. What do we do about it? Our Western ways typically involve separation and purification, which in reality becomes separation and suppression. We send our hated half deep into our shadow, leaving something clean for our persona. But this is not how my people treat Kali. What you do when you find Kali within yourself is quite simple. You tremble, knowing Kali is there, and then you bow. Do not reject your dark mother. That being you face is also you. Now look from her eyes. Who does she see?
