The derpy eyes reminded me of the day we met that dog in the park. You were laughing and making your joke about every hour being golden hour when it ran right up to us, and you went right for it. You always were a sucker for cute little dogs. Someone might say there's nothing special about loving dogs, but it's amazing how amazing the ordinary really is.

For a while I didn't find golden hour again. Literally at first. Drowning myself in late nights playing or partying or both. I'd only feel good and clear of the hangover right before it was time to do it again. The music was pretty dark then, and the crowd loved it. Strange, that. It was the lowest point of my life, and I was making more money than I ever had before.

I had to hit rock bottom. Slipped in my bathroom, dropping a bottle of gin and cutting my foot open on the shards. Blood and gin don't look so great mixed together like that.

Eventually I lost the music, but I got golden hour back. I still miss you though.
