Warrior chewed his thoughts as he walked the winding path to Sage's mountain hut. When he arrived Sage wasn't there, but he'd known this hut since childhood. He pulled water, lit a fire, and began to make the tea he'd brought with. Its mild fragrance mingled with the icy air, and soon Sage appeared with a great big smile on his face. Somehow he hadn't aged a day.

"Sage. I've brought you tea from across the great mountains."

"Welcome back my boy. You've been gone a while. Pass me a cup."

Sage's voice held more layers than anyone else Warrior knew, as if he spoke with the voices of many beings united in one. Between his old teacher's comforting presence and the tea, Warrior's mind began to settle. Sage put his cup down and crossed his legs, waiting.

"I don't know what to do anymore."

Sage said nothing.

"Years ago I left this village to fight in our prince's war. I really believed in our cause. I thought we were fighting to destroy evil and change the world. Now I wonder if all we did was replace one king with another. My contributions to this noble endeavor were noted, and the war left me with more gold than I'll need in this lifetime. I was free to do anything I wanted to. The Kama Sutra states that man's life should fulfill three aims: Dharma, Artha, and Kama. Dharma, my sacred duty, and Artha, the acquisition of material prosperity, I'd thought fulfilled during the war. So I turned to Kama, the life of pleasure and enjoyment. Just as the Sutra says I bought a house in the city and lived like a gentleman. I spent my days practicing the arts: poetry, painting, music. Old war buddies took me to lavish parties flowing with delicious foods and amazing intoxicants. I chased after beautiful women, and some chased me back. My days fell into this pattern."

Warrior paused for a while, looking into the fire. His face changed.

"But things felt off. Somehow I couldn't find happiness. It was like...wherever I was, life was somewhere else. I started to question whether I was living the right life. Was I really connecting to friends and lovers, or were we just spending our days playing out old patterns? Maybe things would have been different if I'd started a family, loved my friends more deeply, or found my way to a life of service. All these things seem to offer some kind of purpose, don't they? What if I'd just committed to being someone and doing something? To a new campaign, to something to fight for, to something real this time."

The fire grew brighter in the fading light. Sage's face reminded Warrior of the Crow Poet Ikkyu's famous line: "only a kind deadly sincere man can show you the way here in the other world." Warrior's mind found new words for his disquiet.

"Sage, how can we know the purpose of our lives? What am I meant to do? What am I missing? What's wrong with me?"

Sage sat for a while saying nothing. Then he poured himself another cup of tea. Warrior felt a little foolish and a little restless. He knew from his years of study under Sage that silence was a kind of answer. Silence speaks with the voice of whatever rises in the gap, and Warrior saw his own self-conscious impatience in Sage's silent mirror. Finally, Sage spoke.

"My boy, tell me this: why does the heart beat?"

A wave of insight rippled in the deep waters of Warrior's mind. He felt this ripple but could not have told you what it meant. Sage spoke again.

"The reason you are unsettled is because you have not discovered your true nature. The I which seeks a purpose is twice deluded, first at the I and second at the purpose. The remedy is simple. This world does not need you to do anything to change it. Nothing is missing, nothing. You are part of it and it makes you each moment. It changes and you change, you change and it changes. Even this is deluded. In all this froth of karma's river, where is the you? You are a good boy and want to make things better. You want to find a nice heartfelt meaning to serve. For now, put that aside. Go be useless. Leave everything aside, especially your ideas about purpose and meaning. Every day, attend to your fundamentals: eat, drink, shit, sit, move, and make a little art. Then, sit at the gates of idleness and boredom. Leave aside any thought of accomplishing anything, finding anything, or learning anything. Just be, without any other expectations. It may be years like this. Settle in a small mountain village within three days' ride, and come bring me tea from time to time."

Warrior was not happy to hear this. Sage had basically told him to do the opposite of what he'd asked for. He was ready to go on any great quest to find and fulfill his purpose--any quest but this! How would wasting his life doing nothing help? He was going to exile himself? Life would definitely be somewhere else if he locked himself up in some village! And what was all that about the world not needing changing? This world was full of darkness. Didn't purpose have to do with improving it, even if in a small and personal way? Why not just do the most good one can? He had half a mind to go back to his life in the city.

For the next three days he sat indecision. Though it was painful, Warrior could tell that he was attached to this inner deliberation and turmoil. Parts of his mind didn't want to understand what other parts of him already understood. But Sage's first words kept coming back to him. Why *did* his heart beat? He sat in meditation asking his heart. He listened with his inner ear. And he heard.

His heart beat for no reason whatsoever. His heart beat just because. His heart had no ideas about reason or no reason. And yet, his heartbeat was pure love to him. Though it had no ideas about Warrior as a person, it worked tirelessly for him. Nor could his heart beat without this whole world. The same way his heart loved him, the sun and the moon and the air and the water loved his heart--without any ideas of love. They were a family; they fit. He knew some believed the gods had designed things this way, while others believed they co-arose together without the gods. Either way, there was something deep about it. Everything was connected in a way that went beyond purpose as humans understood it.

Warrior knew Sage. He trusted Sage to be Sage. But he did not trust himself. His mind churned with confusion and doubt until an old lesson returned to him one night in a dream. He was walking with Sage on a bright beach. Birds squawked, and Sage spoke.

"It is a good question. How indeed does the free person choose? Free of preferences of the mind, the winds of loss and gain not affecting him, the free person chooses freely because he does not need to choose. All he needs is basic trust in life. Truly, the choice was never his: he never chose to be himself. The free person quiets her mind, casting aside her mental deliberations, and she sinks deep into life. She jumps, trusting the sea to catch her one way or the other. Falling free, a choice arises in the mind, and is made. Whatever choice is made then becomes the right choice. Even when this choice is a mistake, it is the right mistake. People think they make their life, but it is life that moment by moment makes the person."

Warrior woke gently from his dream. The sun had not risen yet, and it was cold. He wrapped himself in his shawl, went outside, and sat down. He sunk deep, leaving behind everything else. Somewhere in his mind he felt true gold well up: the courage to be beautiful and dance one's own dance. The dance of the destroyer god knows neither self-consciousness nor other-consciousness--it is this very life itself, the swaying of leaves in the wind and the breaking of branches in the storm. Warrior knew his path. As the sun rose, he set off towards a small mountain village three days' ride away.

Warrior's days passed. He learned the way of satisfaction. It turned out that he required very little. His life wasn't exciting, but it felt solid and healthy. He committed to all of his routines, with perhaps one exception. He let his arts come and go. That was fine; there was nothing to achieve with them anyways. When the time was right he would pick up his ink brush. When the time was right, he would put his ink brush down and pick up his flute. And so it went. Because he allowed himself the space to quit, he didn't feel any anxious desire to quit, but neither did he force himself to keep cooking when the coals had gone cold. The trick was to know when the coals were hot and not to waste that heat. When the heat was right, the art would flow almost of itself. Too hot, and he would be boiling and frothing with energy. Then he'd go dance. Too cool, and he'd get stuck. Then he'd go sit.

Once a month he would ride out to meet Sage, always bringing some tea. They had many conversations. Sometimes Warrior's smallest irritations and confusions would reveal important lessons. Some of Sage's most powerful lessons were delivered in total silence; in these moments Warrior could feel his meditation and insight deepen beyond what he felt away from his teacher's presence. Whenever Warrior asked whether his time of idleness was at an end and whether he was ready to find a purpose, Sage remained quiet. The truth could only be learned directly, and too many explanations could rob the student of that direct experience. No explanations, on the other hand, and the student could get stuck in dead ends. Sage's teachings were like a guided maze which supported and frustrated Warrior at the same time.

It was hard to be without a sense of purpose. For fear of violating the practice of idleness, Warrior didn't let himself think of his lessons with Sage as purposeful, though deep down he couldn't help but cling to them as such. What else did he have but this path? But to be on the path meant letting go even of being on the path. When his mind churned too much with these confusions, he dropped his thoughts and returned to the gates of idleness, waiting patiently for them to open.

One day Warrior was laying on the floor of his hut watching ants clean up a few grains of sugar. He had always found ants beautiful; he loved the way they operated both as individuals and as one single hive mind. Sometimes he could picture all humans everywhere operating in the same way. The ant hive mind sent its ants out in different directions; some directions were bountiful and earned more ants, while other directions were so deadly no ant ever came back. This was how the hive mind learned to map the space. Were human lives like this for the human hive mind? Was this why some people's fates seemed so pointlessly cruel? A nation rises and falls; a tree branch full of ants falls into a river.

He watched the ants explore their space. Since they were explorers, it would never do for every ant to choose the same path. At some point, each ant chose to turn in a new direction. And yet they also seemed to learn from each other. Paths that led to sugar were reinforced; new ants were more likely to follow the trails older ants had traversed in great numbers. How did they do it? Was it smell perhaps?

Warrior found himself writing down rules to a game: the ant game. He wanted to find a set of rules that would mimic ant behavior. He drew a grid similar to the one used in Chaturanga, drawing a few ants and a few grains of sugar on the board. Each turn he would use some rule of his design to move the ants on the board. How would a single ant move if it didn't smell any other ants? Warrior decided to carve an 8-sided die to represent the 8 grid directions an ant could move, and roll the die each turn to pick a random direction for the ant to move in. Generations later, mathematicians would call this discovery the random walk. Other rules arose in his mind naturally and spontaneously, ways to mimic the smell-based trails he thought the ants might be using. He worked for 9 hours straight, carving more complicated die and working out different kinds of rules, then trying them out on his board. He kept working on his game for the next few days, until the fire in him cooled.

By the time Warrior next visited Sage, he'd almost forgotten about the game. When he briefly brought it up, Sage's eyes lit up. He began asking Warrior questions.

"What was it like when you started making the game?"

"Well, it was really easy. There was no pressure, since it's not like anything was at stake. I mean, it's a totally useless project. It's not an actual game people are going to want to play. I can't sell it because who would buy it? I just felt like making it."

"And how was the process of making it? How did you see your way forward?"

"It was smooth. I didn't even really have to think about it. I mean, there was plenty of thinking, but the overall design for the game and the various pieces, rules, and concepts, just kind of popped into my mind. At first I built the simplest version of it, and only where more complexity was needed did I feel any desire to add to it. Whenever I did, a new idea would just pop up the same way words are coming out of my mouth right now without any kind of planning."

"And where were your intentions while making the game? How did they shape the game?"

"I didn't really have fixed intentions. After all, this game has no real purpose. I didn't need it to be anything. So it became what it is. It's almost like it created itself through my hands and mind, rather than being something that I created."

Sage smiled. "You've finally solved it."

Warrior was surprised. He'd thought he'd solved it many times before but Sage had never accepted any of his answers.

"I don't understand. What does this have to do with idleness?"

"You don't understand! That's funny. As usual, you're slow to know what you know. That's ok; that's why you have me here, to be a mirror in which you can see yourself. So I'll tell you about what you've learned. Purpose is something the ego, the I, creates and projects and spends its life chasing. Only when you've sat in idleness for long enough does this deeply entrenched pattern learn to relax. When it relaxes, your true creative powers manifest themselves naturally. That's what happened when you made this game. Since you are no longer restricting creation with thoughts of I want this and I think that, creation arises spontaneously. Freed of the you, there is no longer any need to construct a meaning, purpose, or use for your life. Your life just creates itself. Actually, it always did. You just couldn't recognize that. So you chased after stories that constricted and suffocated your true being. Being is not for anything. Being just is. On the true path there is neither any path, nor any walker, nor anywhere to go, nor anywhere to arrive from. That is why it is a true path."

Sage's confusing words washed over Warrior, and somehow they made sense. He understood the riddle of idleness and purpose with his heart more than his mind. The self's desire for purpose and definition was so natural and so hard to transcend. But the world truly was a useless place; it existed just because. It created itself for no other reason than to be. Warrior too was part of this world. Like the air he breathed and the heart that beat for him, he had no need for a reason to live. Being was his birthright. There was nowhere to go because he had already arrived. As long as he remembered how to put his trust in that, creative energy would work through him. Warrior smiled as he realized that he was now beyond useless.

"So, what now? What do I do?" Warrior asked.

"What do you think?"

"I have no idea."

"It took you long enough," Sage laughed.
