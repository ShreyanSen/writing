I'm writing from Mexico during Day of the Dead. People build public altars--*ofrendas*--to remember the dead. You'll find huge artistic ones on display with people lined up to see them, and you'll find smaller ones tucked into the corner of taco shops. The altars typically include pictures of those who are being remembered. Some of them were too young. Maybe they all were.

I appreciate this open honest cultural confrontation with death. Typically, death is hidden away. We may confront it at funerals, but we live feeling like we'll never die. Of course we know we'll die. But we don't live our impermanence. I don't mean yolo fuck tomorrow. I mean that no matter what we do, ultimately the result is the same. People who live for the destination and not the journey usually aren't honest with themselves, because there is only one destination.

Now we live in the anthropocene. Human beings are triggering mass extinctions driven by climate change and other disasters that we have caused. Before this is all over, billions will die. I know people who are in deep depression over this fact, people pouring their whole life energy into stopping it. Into saving us. Only, nobody on this planet has ever been saved. Only the circumstances of their death have been changed. When you save someone, you just kill them a different way. More importantly, you offer them another chance to make their own way to live.

This is not Earth's first extinction event, and I'd like to think it won't be her last. If death is a necessary part of life, clearing the ground for new life to come forth, then what if our true role as humans is to humbly serve as the grim reaper's blade? We think too much of ourselves. Always imagining ourselves as separate from nature. There's the natural, and the man-made. Except humans have never left the natural, and nothing we make is any different. Let me tell you one of my favorite tree facts. There was a time when the fungi and bacteria that break down the lignin and cellulose in trees' bodies didn't exist yet. When trees died, they didn't decompose. They were pretty much made out of plastic. And this period lasted 60 million years! As disgusting as the great garbage patches we've dumped in the ocean are, it's our human arrogance to think they won't be consumed in 60 million years.

Alcohol fermentation is another story with a useful perspective to offer. Alcohol is a by-product of yeast that are eating the sugars in some nice corn mash or grape juice. That by-product is toxic to those very same yeast, and when enough yeast eat through enough sugar, the toxin build-up eventually kills them all. The yeast become victims of their own success. We like to think we are so smart, but when I see us pumping carbon into the atmosphere and making record profits, I don't notice any difference between us and the yeast. We are shitting in our own pool and eventually we'll die off because of it.

But dying off is not a tragedy. It's just a bottle of wine. It is an unavoidable part of life, our inevitable personal fate, the thing we must each confront by ourselves. The tragedy of climate change is not in our death and in the death of so many of our neighboring species.

The tragedy of climate change is in the journey, not the destination. It's in how we lived, not in how we died. We lived without learning how to stand up. We lived without learning how to cherish life. How to be honest, brave, and intentional. We lived hurting ourselves and the beautiful beings we share this planet with.

There is actually nothing wrong with any of that. Being ignorant, cowardly, and foolish is not unnatural. Even hurting others is part of nature. The tragedy within the tragedy isn't that we became death's tool or that we looked ugly doing it. But is this who we really are? The tragedy within the tragedy is that we didn't become who we really are. We didn't wake up in time. We didn't witness our real selves. Instead we just lived in an ugly dream filled with fentanyl and parking lots. What a fucking waste. I hope it turns out different next time.

If we wake up, it'll have nothing to do with saving the planet or even saving ourselves. It'll be because we found within ourselves what was worth living, and we stopped doing the things that didn't matter.
