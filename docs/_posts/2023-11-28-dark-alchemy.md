"What is it?"

"It looks like an encrypted dialogue from the early 21st. Pre-quantum!"

"That can't be right. There shouldn't be anything that old down here. This part of the Archives is supposed to be all full of FlatPak zygote training data and empty semiotic fluid calibrators, that kind of thing."

The two amateur archivists were doing what they usually did with their free time: junk diving in the vast swathes of the Archives deemed too worthless to mine. Legend has it all kinds of seedy entities still functioned down there. Like ancient code vampires, hunting for code to eat. Or even worse: lost archivists, wandering in the dark looking for endpoints. Nothing will pull you down faster than a drowning man.

"I don't know. Should we crack it?"

"Come on, Billiam. You already know what I'm going to say."

cw: trauma, abuse, all that ouchie stuff
<br/><br/>


"Tell us about your experience," Jion said.  

"I felt like I broke through to something; real love for myself? It was amazing. What I experienced was like some kind of crazy ritual dance, some real dark alchemical inner realm yoga. The grounds of the ritual flow back in time unceasingly--"

"Speak plainly, Sozan."

"Right. Ok. Let's start at the beginning. We've been working together for a year and a half. The basic Zen Therapy method as I understand it is to go to your triggers, but to allow them to unfold in awareness instead of becoming overwhelmed and identifying with the pattern of reaction that usually follows. Meditation increases your capacity to experience that open awareness without falling into identification--that's from the Zen half. Usually these triggers relate to some suppressed or shadow aspect of yourself--internal disconnection in your psyche. As you accept and integrate these parts of yourself over time, you gain more stability and can therefore go deeper--that's from the therapy half. Stability is important, because shadow work is dangerous. You can lose yourself in it, in a bad way. It's not a coincidence that most Buddhist teachings you hear go in the totally opposite direction. Thich Nhat Hanh's Zen, for example, asks us to constantly cultivate awareness of peace, kindness, and other wholesome states and to divert from anger and other unwholesome states. This is based on the insight that each time you activate your anger pathway it strengthens, and each time you don't it atrophies. A very different path from freeing your kindness by meeting your hate."

"You're boring everyone with your theories."

"I don't know, some of them are nerds. But ok. So on that day in our session, I asked you why it is that after all this work, I still didn't easily feel joy? I could feel its absence on my clenched, unsmiling face. Like there's this critical grump in me who actually looks down on anyone who thought it was a good idea to be happy. Happiness doesn't get the good grades!

You said it was probably the suppressed anger in my solar plexus. All those dark clouds were cutting off the energy to my heart, growing inwards since they weren't allowed to express outwards. Because I force myself to try to be this peaceful kind person. 

The answer was to express in awareness. Specifically, you suggested I watch and practice Butoh, the contemporary Japanese dance of darkness built to process collective grief and trauma after Americans bombed Nagasaki and Hiroshima. In Butoh one does the opposite of suppressing by expressing: scream, groan, cry, move with my body. 

As these things tend to happen, a Butoh class quickly found me. Thankfully it wasn't a very popular class, so I got a one on one tutorial. After warming up our bodies and hearts, we moved into some basic exercises which combined open-eyed visualizations (narrated by the teacher) with a slow, strange walk. Together we imagined hell realms and walked through them, feeling as we went. And they were some real hell realms. In one, I was a survivor running through a dark damp horrible cave. Each step was disgusting and painful as the rocks cut my feet and the bugs crawled over me. The only thing worse than moving forward through the cave was the thing still chasing behind me. Another exercise involved walking through the aftereffects of a bomb over the corpses of the dead who were once friends and ancestors. I crawled over a beach of bones towards a boat that left before I could reach it. Then I died on that beach.

Nasty stuff. I connected to and gave voice to the horrors within. The awful gut-wrenching feeling I get when I can't stand the injustice--my silent scream. The rage that alternates with grief, which also alternates with a deep will to survive--a precursor perhaps to self-love. I cried and screamed. I felt a lot of things, and it's always a mistake in this practice to gather those things up as treasures and present them like homework assignments to one's teacher. A mistake I never fail to make."

"Come back to your story."

"Right. Butoh. I did connect to deeper layers of myself and witness them, and in this practice that's enough. You don't need to analyze or come up with a theory. Any theory is probably just some neat little idea you'll use to seal yourself back up. But we want to stay open, to allow these mechanisms to operate in the light of awareness. They will come to self-regulate themselves and integrate into the broader system, even if there is no aha insight you can summarize. The healing is happening in the subconscious.

You'll have to do it again and again, each time going deeper. It's like a spiral--you visit the same places inside, but each time is different. My breakthrough past the anger into love came a few days later, when I traced another round of anger instead of suppressing it.

I was upset at my mom about something trivial. My upset energy was actually being pretty unfair, and my self-proclaimed higher self was telling me to reign it in and be the bigger person. 

Listening to this higher self was a mistake I'd already made last week. In the family group chat, my dad had commented on a career setback I'd experienced saying it only meant life wanted something greater for me. To a stranger it might sound like a supportive sentiment, but I've been drafted into his vicarious dream of greatness my whole life. So I took his comment the way he meant it (as a whip, orienting me back towards his Great Expectations) and I got mad and pushed back. Afterwards I apologized for being mean. And you told me this was exactly wrong this time. It took me backwards on my growth path, falling back to my conditioning as a people-pleasing victim who doesn't want the victimizer to be upset. Whether my dad was mean or not and whether we should be mean to meanies wasn't the issue--it was my reliance on my own conditioned response that was the issue. That time I needed to voice my resentment honestly, freeing myself from my family system of meaning so I can move towards my own."

"Come back."

"Right. So, this time when I got upset at my mom, I revived the triggered feeling later in the day and allowed it to go where it needed to go. It grew fast into the seething flame I know and don't love. I allowed myself to go fully into expressing it without judging it. The anger had little to do with the situation and everything to do with thousands of situations that have come before. I took martial stances to express it with my body, punched and kicked and yelled. Viciousness arrived. Eventually I grabbed my wooden flute and I started swinging it, beating this imaginary parent figure with it. Yes, I felt, take the beating you stupid piece of shit! It cringed and crouched the same way I did the hundreds of times my parents beat me with a wooden ladle.

The rage mixed with sorrow and the silent scream I felt in Butoh. WHY!? A scream of an enraged child who feels so hurt and betrayed. UNFAIR! What happens when our very source of love becomes what hurts us? STOP! How does a child understand this?

I HATE YOU!

Pain. Sorrow. Unfairness. Bitterness. Rage.

I HATE ALL OF YOU!

Silent scream, tears down my face. Growling, teeth grit. Collapsing on my bed, weeping. Snot running down my nose, so much of it I had to take some breaks to go wash it off. Remember, you let it summon itself, but you hold it in awareness too. You can take a break even, but don't kill the process.

I saw a pattern. I saw how the rage alternated with the emotional pain. It was trying to protect me, actually. Trying to change a reality it did not have the power to change. But this same rage projected outwards in all directions. It made the whole world its enemy. How can you trust and love when a part of you sees everything, everyone, as a hated enemy? Worse than that, the hate demon only knows how to hold with hate. It even holds you that way. I saw how my self-critical voice connects to the hate demon and his continuous defense. I saw how, in its efforts to stop my pain, it blocks any possibility of holding myself gently.

I'd arrived at a nice theory that I was cognizant of. I let the theory go. What matters isn't ideas--it's reshaping, like a volcano that reshapes pressures below it. I intuited that I should let the process continue, neither rushing it towards a conclusion, nor trying intentionally to deepen or extend it. 

It continued, and I passed from the cycle of hate and pain to a deeper fear and powerlessness, vulnerability and violation. The fear when there's something bad that's going to happen to you, and you know there's nothing you can do about it. It was horrible to feel this way. Within me, there's always a child feeling this way, locked in this state, expecting the next blow. I experienced periods of hyperventilation. The snot and tears continued to flow. Important to experience this as a bodily phenomena--that's why in our method we spend so long training to identify feelings in the body and not just in our mind. 

Eventually this terrified child passed through to surrender and even to a kind of death. Not too dissimilar to the surrender I experienced as a child, when I'd finally exhaust myself as I rage cried to sleep. But this time I was witnessing the process in awareness, not becoming it.

Next came the final stage. With confidence, I trusted my intuition which told me that I must both comfort the child and be the child who is comforted. First I tried becoming a ball and squeezing. Then, in the fetal position, I remained the child, but my hands became the one who comforts the child. I held my own face softly. I stroked my cheek and my hair as I whimpered into my hands. Such gentleness arose. A gentleness and tenderness that I've rarely expressed in the past. My hands became the gentle and kind parent, and I discovered what it was to hold myself this way. I saw that this child's whole body was like one great burn wound, and the method he uses to protect himself (the hate demon's subconscious rejection and pushing away of the entire world) acted as a flame that continued to burn him. My love and tenderness became a concentrated layer of aloe and spread over the child's skin, cooling, rehydrating, and protecting. I felt very naturally that he deserved this easing of the pain, and I didn't have to make any effort to find the will to give it to him. In time, he would make a full recovery, and begin again his vital activity.

I had penetrated into a source energy of my own heart. There was actually an ocean of love in there, not just my own. I just didn't know how to open the door. I felt that there was nothing more important than my having found this door, and having connected to my own gentleness and kindness for myself. The suppressed anger that blocked my heart had been pierced through. Wisdom released it; something else was not only needed, but spontaneously and happily arose to support and protect the inner child's natural functioning. The wise and kind inner parent established itself. In a way I became a father. 

Everything won't change overnight. The suffering this child has experienced is still there. But something has shifted, and a new trajectory is possible. One which does not use conditional love to goad the child, forcing it to waste its life seeking the unconditional love which should have powered the start of its true life.

I spent the next day maintaining mindful awareness of this gentle and kind energy. I was afraid I would lose it if I didn't let it settle and establish itself. But I also knew even before you told me Jion that this too was a mistake. If its natural functioning really broke through, it won't need my clinging to maintain itself. Nor will I always feel its presence; there's going to be times when I do feel upset or anxious. But the gentleness, from parent to child, will return. Let me come back now."

"Well done, Sozan. That's enough for now. You've written and shared your experience, and it can serve as a kind of teaching."

"Thanks, Jion. Yeah, it was a lot to write this all down. What should I do with it?"

"Seal it and throw it away."
