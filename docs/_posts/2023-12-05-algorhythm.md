i understood the weaver more through intuition than through my meager spanish. she spoke of weaving as a kind of meditation. when you weave, you get lost in the weaving. algorhythmic: up, down, through, out. until you finish. and by that time, you've fully left yourself in the weaving. you look up surprised and free. 

the point of so-called inner work is not to know yourself, it's to be yourself. we talk about self-knowledge as if we're some outsider who's going to hold that self-knowledge. if only i had self-knowledge, then i could manipulate that self and its conditions better to make that self happy or productive or beautiful or strong or worthy. but aren't your depths unfathomable? you don't know that self and you never will, but you can know being them. 

i was once in a phil bio class where free will was all the rage. i remember feeling like the opposite of deterministic and unfree was scarily unconstrained. does freedom mean i'm free to randomly stand up and throw my plate against the wall? why don't i then? am i unfree because i don't? if i have the choice but would never take it, does it matter that i had the choice? maybe i'm me exactly because i never had a choice, because my being me means choosing what i chose. that guy throwing the plate against the wall might be free, but he's not me. 

is freedom really what you want? you really want to be someone who feels free to quit your job, sell everything, and move to oregon to start life over as a janitor? now there's real freedom. how scary! you probably wouldn't do such an erratic thing because you already have an idea of who you are and it's probably someone else. sorry this bathroom is occupied.

when you're free you still probably won't quit your life and move to oregon to start life over as a janitor. you probably won't, but you could. you could in the sense that you could follow yourself anywhere. you know who you are, whoever you become. you're not always wondering if this is the right place for you, because you've learned to live so that wherever you go is the right place. but it's not the place that makes it right. it's right because of how you arrived there. you arrived there by being yourself. it's completely different from playing the script you think is you.

this art is an improvisation which continues to embrace dissonant notes. just the other day Dogen said: "a zen master's life is one continuous mistake." what do you think that means? how does a free person wander from mistake from mistake? wasn't i just saying wherever you go is right? who is this idiot? Seneca once said: "if one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable." Seniam replied: "if one does not know to which port one is sailing, any wind might do."

all this to say, when you don't have to be anyone, who is left?

a funny thing popped into my head today. the unprompted mindfeel of a Karen arrived and demanded angrily--"just who do you think you are?"

yes, this is exactly the right question. thank you, Karen. just who do you think you are?
