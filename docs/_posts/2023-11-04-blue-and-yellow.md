I get down and take a good deep sniff. This time is the last time. A man is coming over in about an hour and if all goes well these tatami will be gone and my futon will be free of a bed frame once more.

There is a lot you can do on a tatami. The best thing is to just smell it; that earthy, grassy, seaweed smell is addicting and I was heartbroken until I realized I could always find it in certain teas and certain grains. I'm not sure why I'm leaving new york which is appropriate because I wasn't sure why I came here either but for a while the tatami was near the top of my list of reasons why I couldn't leave, the list largely being a product of my practice of self-deception.

The smell, my childhood proclivity to lounge around on the floor, and the way light moves in this room make this good. I have maybe 40 minutes left of this writing meditation but I wish it was an hour. Goodbyes get me existential. This morning I spilled blue ink all over my hands trying to revive my fountain pen so I could put a goodbye note in my favorite book. The spill was in accordance with fundamental woo woo laws of the universe, such as let the insides match the outsides / as within so without / as above so below. The room is blue too as is my comforter spread oppressively over pink sheets, but it's the yellow of the tatami and the yellow of the sun and the yellow wooden floors that support the joy in the space.

Why is it always existential angst? What about existential laughter. What about existential boredom. What about existential ramen broth. I have been reading all day, reading all my life really, always as a way to escape my own life and enter another's. There's something to that, and there's also something to the horrific error of escaping one's own life, and there's also something to learning to read your own life as though it were a book someone else wrote. That last one we call secret ninja art: alienating the alienation. Would that make everything more bearable? The long boring pauses could all be existential sighs and dewdrops could all be pregnant with meaning as if the song of your soul was always there directing you, if only you'd take your headphones out and listen.

It's always angst because angst is most accessible of all the existentials. It's not the worst one though. Existential joy and its legion of positivity are the worst--what are you so delirious about my guy? Manifesting another sunrise? You don't have to hit the joy button every moment, not every dewdrop has to be so pregnant, it can just be an existential dewdrop sometimes. Yes, it's true I'm a jealous hater. No, being a hater doesn't even give me any joy, just a lukewarm comfort in its absence. It's not even a good trade, kind of a ripoff really, but it beats vaping.

I'm off topic and the sun's almost gone. Hopefully it's just a cloud passing by but I should hurry up and vibe. What I needed to say to y'all was yes, please give me more books. I want to feel more existentials, beyond the angst and the joy (which, for the record, it's not like I've never felt, I think). Like you I'm missing something, or many things; what makes me unique are the things I'm missing, which aren't the same as the ones you are. There are things in me that were never activated and never got used and never got strong. I don't know what they are because if I did I'd have them, so it's a bit like looking for your own eyeballs. Somehow I'm sure that if I try to live in the hearts and skins of others long enough and I really listen I'll start to feel my parts, they'll activate of their own accord, just like the way we first learned language. So send me some more books. Alright, I have to go, he's here.
