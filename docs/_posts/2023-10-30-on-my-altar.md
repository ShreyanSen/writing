Like any other addict, I tried taking another hit. C was such a breath of fresh air and so unlike S. Sensible, cerebral, so good at asking questions in order to slyly escape your own. The right kind of woman to meet when you're finally tired of all your bullshit dreams.

Being with S felt like one of those dreams. That's what you get with a woman so spiritual you worry she might have actually been dissociating the whole time. Love fated at first sight, an artifact of past lives she said, and jealousy just as old. Our fate involved a prophecy with three Leos, of which I was the second. The first asked to marry her a week into knowing her; she said that's just how devotees are, and I suggested that's just how some men are. On our second date she put a ring on the ring finger of my left hand; it was the snake ring of her lofi softcore cult, the same one she wore. You're supposed to wear it on only that finger, ostensibly so the copper could ground you when you get too spiritually high and float right out of your body. The cult probably doesn't mind that you get to feel married to The Guru. She warned me quite seriously that I'd be putting my health at risk if I wore it elsewhere, but that wasn't why I wore it there. I was enjoying a dream of my own. No harm in that, right?


If you look very carefully on the internet you'll find official cult material suggesting that it's not necessarily going to kill you to wear it on the pinky finger of the left hand. That's what I did the day we broke up for the last time. It's conveniently resizable and I didn't want to throw it away. Plus it felt too cruel the time I tried to give it back. What does one do with love returned?


S wore green bangles taken off the goddess, gifted to her because they wouldn't fit anyone else's wrists. Her touch was so soft and gentle you wondered if she moved at 0.75x speed, a tempo set by the simulation itself to feather wreck the electricity in your brain. My touch was less gentle, and the last time I saw her I broke one of those bangles. I didn't know it would be the last time for a while, and later that night I repaired it and placed it on my altar where it joined other shapely bits of stone, crystal, and memory. It's just plastic, but its emerald green has a depth to it that catches in my little monkey heart. And I'd wanted to remember.


The much-maligned Manic Pixie Dream Girl was always more trap than trope, an abominable projection with abominable results, and yet that's not quite fair. People are actually a little like that, sometimes. People are sometimes quite extraordinary. Collective trauma pathways poured us into collective moulds, playing chicken and egg games with tropes and those they resemble. The ultimate form of people-pleasing is to please People itself, and People is a thing with no fixed face and no real address and the gurgling river sound of many voices mixed together that lives inside you feeding on your careful attentions. You might accidentally waste your whole life this way. But you feel you have no other choice--what would People say? The question is so embedded you can't even feel it, all you feel is a sense of unease. So you become like a movie and chase what it means to be alive, not knowing you already knew.

Hah! What a bunch of words. Only loosely connected to the rest, too; they don't mean much, other than that I wanted to say them, and someone wanted to hear them.

So what really happened? Sometimes people just break themselves (their hearts, their brains) running away from their pain--even when they're running towards enlightenment. As for me, I have learned no special lesson. I reassured C that you can't be the best at everything, you can't be so smart and also be so sexy and so likable and so kind and so wise. You've got to spread your points out, and it's best to have a nice even spread with a few sharp peaks, "in everything something" as my own teacher once said. C asked where I put my points, and I half-lied and said "idiocy." But the half-truth is, I'm putting my points into being ordinary. And it's a forgivably ordinary thing to see that green glint left on my altar, and turn away from the memory.
