muddy dirt at the bottom of my cup <br>
sitting it settles, clear water rises <br>
but when i drink...
<br/><br/>
from this very mud <br>
life-giving irritations <br>
it turns out i can't be any other way
<br/><br/>
the sun rose while i slept <br>
please accept this dear humble gift <br>
i offer you nothing whatsoever
